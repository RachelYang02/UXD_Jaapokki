          <h5>EXPERIMENT DESIGN</h5>
          <p>Much of our feedback throughout the design process has been about the
             first task a user attempts when they visit our app: using our search function.
             We flipped between a mad-libs style search form with a lot of structure, and a
             completely free form search bar, but neither was really satisfactory to our users.
             We’d like to improve on our initial ideas and rigorously test which is better and why.
             We are operating under the assumption that our current implementation of the search
             function is the wrong implementation for our users, and that another version might
             more effectively communicate the capabilities and uses of the feature.</p>
           </br>
           <p>Our (quasi-)control is our current free-form search augmented with a better explanation.
             The first alternative option we’ll be testing is a search bar with animated ghost text that suggests
             possible search queries. We’ll also test another iteration of the mad-libs style form (a number of
             text boxes with specific requested inputs), improved based on our previous feedback. </p>
           </br>
           <p>As such, the things that will vary include the explanation text above the search bar,
             the ghost text, and the specificity of the search bar. In each of the three different
             versions, only the one element specific to that version will vary: the other two elements
             will be constant. For example, in the quasi-control version, the explanation text will be
             expanded, but the ghost text and number of search bars/function of the search bar will not
             be changed. Elements that will remain constant throughout all three versions include the
             task the test subject is assigned and the feedback received from searching (the search
             results and how they are displayed).</p>
           </br>
           <p>In order to test all three versions against each other A/B-style, we’ll bring in at least
             three users and have them each look at two of our designs. We’ll start by asking them how
             easy they expect the task to be. We’ll then ask them to complete the task using our interfaces,
             and observe how quickly they’re able to accomplish it, and how frustrated they become.
             Finally, we’ll ask them how easy the task was, and how confident they are in being able
             to do a similar task again. Then we’ll give them each a number of cookies corresponding
             to how useful their feedback was.In order to test all three versions against each other
