          <h5>WHAT IS DONATR</h5>
        </br>
          <p>Donatr is a web platform for facilitating collaborative donation.
            From the homepage, users can search whatever is relevant to their
            donation needs. The user is automatically presented with a list of
            donation centers relevant to their search, along with basic information
            about each result, including what items are accepted and the center’s
            address. Clicking on a result shows more detailed information about
            that specific donation center. From here, users have ideally found
            enough information to decide if they want to use this donation center
            and how to get there. Furthermore, users can also schedule a pickup
            from this page, which entails scheduling for a donation center employee
            or a volunteer to pick up their items for donating. Before scheduling
            a pickup, however, the user has to login. Before scheduling a pickup,
            users (who are not already logged in) are prompted to login. Users can
            also access the login page from anywhere on the app. Once logged in,
            users have access to their profile page, which provides a way to view
            the user’s donation history and any future scheduled pickups.</p>
           </br>
           <p>Donatr is unique. To our knowledge, there does not exist a similar product
           that serves both as a comprehensive database of local donation centers,
           detailing what goods donation centers can and cannot accept and other
           information about the organizations, and as a platform for donors to
           schedule pickups. Donatr saves donors time and energy, and makes
           donating goods a more accessible practice.</p>

         <h5>RATIONALE</h5>
       </br>
         <p>In our <a style="color:#4682B4" href="http://hfid.olin.edu/sa2018/jaapokki/needs.html">Needs Analysis Report</a>,
           we identified two key user groups based on their motivations; those who
           had to get rid of stuff because of a life change, and those who wanted
           to donate for the sake of helping others. Our first group of users were
           low on time, had limited access to transportation, and needed to donate
           specific items. Donatr fulfills all these needs: searching for donation
           centers that accept specific items is quick and easy, and finding a way
           to transport your goods is simplified by our volunteer/donation center
           pickup system. Our second group was willing to put more effort in, but
           also cared more about the causes their donations supported. Our application
           prominently displays information about the charities, and links these users
           to more information. It also allows them to give their time by volunteering
           to pickup other peoples’ goods, and displays their impact on their profile page.</p>
         </br>
         <p>Additionally, our users need Donatr to maintain their privacy and safety.
           As our interface allows for user-to-user communication, there are special
           considerations to be made with regard to who can volunteer to pick-up
           donations (for example, registered sex offenders might be precluded from
           registering as a volunteer) and how users schedule volunteer pickups
           (for example, profile photo-based systems, such as Uber, perpetuates
           racism through implicit bias). We have not had time to fully prototype
           and implement systems to ensure user privacy and safety, but this
           field would be immediately necessary to research in future work.</p>
         </br></br>
         <h5>DESIGN DECISIONS</h5>
       </br>
         <p>Some key design decisions are highlighted in our feature call-outs below.</p>

         <div class="outterBound row">
          <div class="insideSize col-sm-6">

           style="width:500px; height:690px;" frameborder="0"></iframe>
         </div>
         <div class="insideSize col-sm-6">
           <iframe src="images/final/toggle.pdf"
           style="width:500px; height:690px;" frameborder="0"></iframe>
         </div>
       </div>
     </br></br>




         <p>We were forced to scope our prototype to fit our time constraints.
           In that process, for example, we chose to only implement the donor-side
           interaction, and did not prototype the volunteer-side interaction.
           Further simplifications are detailed in the Trade-Offs + Down-Scoping
           section of our <a style="color:#4682B4" href="http://hfid.olin.edu/sa2018/jaapokki/designrefinement.html">Design Refinement report</a>. As we moved into usability
           testing, we prioritized researching options for our search function,
           since it is highly visible (it lives on the homepage) and is critical
           to the overall experience. In the future, we would conduct further
           usability studies on other features, including the pickup scheduling
           page and the user profile.
