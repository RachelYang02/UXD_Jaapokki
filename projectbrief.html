          <pb>below is our project brief, detailing our motivation and goals for this project. before conducting
             any user visits, we made sure we received permissions by giving our users this
             <a href=consent.html>consent form</a>.</pb>

          <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
          <p>How might we help connect people who want to donate specific goods to nonprofits
             and other groups that need those goods via a software interface?</p>
          </br></br></br>

          <h5>Δ STATUS QUO</h5>
          <p>People looking to donate will have an easier experience finding what would be most
            valuable to donate and how to do so; the activation energy required for donating will
            decrease. By broadcasting their needs and current supplies, nonprofits and donation
            centers can more easily help those in need.</p>
          </br></br></br>

          <h5>DESIGN IDEA</h5>
          <p>A web app* that enables potential donors to locate nearby donation centers accepting
            the kinds of goods they want to donate.</p>
          <p class="extra-padding">Donation centers, nonprofits, and other groups would broadcast
            the goods that they need. Donors would go onto the web app, and input the goods that
            they have to donate. This would pull up with a list or map of nearby donation acceptors
            for the given goods (maybe sorted by distance or relevancy), that upon clicking, would
            provide information on how to donate. We could also have intermediaries (grocery stores that
            collect donations, people willing to shuttle goods from a neighborhood to an organization) who
            can view matches and facilitate them.</p>
          </br>
          <p>*whatever form this takes, we want the interface to be mobile-friendly and have accessible features.</p>
          </br></br></br>

          <h5>REQUIRED INFORMATION</h5>
          <p>We would need to understand the current frustrations and common blocking agents for donation
            centers when it comes to collecting donations, and for potential donors trying to figure out how best
            to donate. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we would need to know what makes donations easy for
            either group of users, and if there is something like this out there already that they use (if so, what).
            We can collect this information through user visits, observation, and asking them to reflect on their
            experiences. Once we narrow down the specific type of donation centers we want to focus on, we can either
            ask other students to share contacts they have collected from previous projects or research contact information
            for those types of donation centers within our area. We will then reach out and establish contact via email or a phone call.</p>
          </br></br></br>

          <h5>TEAM DYNAMIC</h5>
          <p>We’ll work together to research the problems facing our users, then design a mockup of a potential solution.
            We’ll then put our mockup in front of users and use their feedback to improve our initial ideas and calibrate our assumptions.
            We will iterate on this process until we are confident we have an adequate prototype. Our learning goals were largely centered
            around creating intuitive designs with users in mind, and as such we will work together as a team to seek frequent feedback and
            implement our project.  Another learning goal is centered around mobile-friendly interface design, so we will be placing equal
            weight on mobile and desktop versions of the interface, if we choose to pursue a web interface.</p>
