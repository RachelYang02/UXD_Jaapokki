          <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
          <p>How might we help connect people who want to donate specific goods to nonprofits
             and other groups that need those goods via a software interface?</p>
          </br><br>

          <h5>WHO IS AFFECTED</h5>
          <p>Potential donors who are unsure about if, where, and how they can
              donate certain items, and donation centers that often have to reject
              goods that aren’t relevant to their mission or cannot be processed
              at their facilities.</p>
          </br></br>
          <pbe>DONORS</pbe>
          <p class="extra-padding">When donating, some of our users prioritize
            getting it done: they need to get rid of things, and they need to do
            it in a timely manner.  Of our four donor personas, two fall into this
            category; Nomadic Norman is a potentially altruistic
            college-aged person who needs to get rid of extra stuff when they move.
            They don’t think it’s right to just throw perfectly good stuff away,
            but their main concern is getting everything taken care of in the short
            time period they have. They care, but time and transportation are limited
            resources for them, so the activation energy to donate has to be very low.
            Sudden Sam also falls into this category.  Sam is someone who experiences
            a death in the family and suddenly finds themself responsible for an estate.
            They are looking to deal with this stuff in an efficient manner and not
            dwell on the process, but want things to go to good homes.  Sam prioritizes
            convenience over all else. </p>
          </br>
          <div class="col-md-7 col-md-6">

          <div class = "col-md-7 col-md-6">
            <img src="images/personas/sudden.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
          </div>
        </br>
          <p class="extra-padding">The other subset of our donors prioritizes doing
            good: they can afford to spend more time on the donation process in order
            to give things their best new homes.  Woke Wanda is a 40-something mom
            who gets rid of things to keep the family home in order.  She cares
            about the environment and chooses to donate these things in order to
            reduce waste, and also to help those in need.  She donates frequently,
            and she has a car, so she is able to bring her things to the best fit
            donation center without distance being a dominant deciding factor.
            Bored Bernie is a quintessential do-gooder: they’re in their 60s and
            seeking to give back to the community.  They have a fair amount of
            free time and choose to volunteer frequently.  When they find themself
            with something they don’t need, they want to ensure it goes to someone
            who can make good use of it, but they might struggle to leverage
            technology to do so.  They would prefer to find donation acceptors
            nearby, but they’re the kind of person who would take the bus for
            upwards of 40 minutes to get something to the right place.</p>

          <pbe>DONATION CENTER COORDINATORS</pbe>
          <p class="extra-padding">For our Donation Center Coordinators, we have
            another two subsets of users that both have the same end-goal: to create
            the best impact in the community. Our first subset of users believes
            this is achieved by fully integrating and engaging with the community.
            Community Carl is intensely passionate about his non-profit’s cause,
            and wants to promote outreach and awareness of this cause in the community
            by marketing in person, in public settings. He’s a people-person, and
            prefers to engage with donors and customers face-to-face. Go-Getter
            Gertrude is just as passionate about her organization’s cause, but
            she’s much more tech-savvy. She knows exactly what her donation center
            needs, and she leverages social media, Craigslist, and other web technology
            to get those things.</p>
          </br>
          <div class="col-md-7 col-md-6">

          </div>
        </br>
          <p class="extra-padding">Our second subset of users believes that, in
            order to best create impact in the community, they need to focus mainly
            on running their business well and efficiently. Business-Savvy Byron
            is high up in the management chain of his organization, and he’s
            old-school. He believes that a good business depends heavily on friendly
            customer service, and he’s less up-to-date with the newer technology. He wants
            to create return donors by making donating an easier process (and by including
            more motivation for donors), and he wants more customers so that his organization
            can create more revenue. Boots-On-The-Ground Bailey is a little bit less
            motivated than Byron — he is lower on the rung and treats his job as just
            that, a job. He is a bit more tech-literate than Business-Savvy Byron,
            but relies more on being told what to do than taking initiative. </p>

          <p>2x2 matrices to better develop our personas.</p>
        </br>
          <h5>REQUIRED INFORMATION</h5>
          <p>Through our user research, talking with both donors and donation center employees,
             we have identified what is important to donors and donation centers and what problems
             they face. In general, donors tend to care about how easy donating is and what sort of
             impact they can make with their donations. Their main problem is centered around physically
             delivering goods to donation centers.
           </br></br>
             Donation centers care about encouraging and motivating people to donate from the community,
             not just once, but multiple times. They’re passionate about the cause and mission of their
             organizations, and they want to give people the opportunity to make a big impact in their
             community. Their main problem is centered around making it clear what it is they need to be
             donated, as well as making it easier for people to donate repeatedly.
           </br></br>
             Our solution needs to be quick and easy to use. Donors typically have busy lives and have varying
             levels of experience with technology, so our solution needs to be intuitive and involve quick interactions.
             Having a mobile-friendly solution will add to the ease of use of our product, so emphasizing a mobile-first
             approach in our development process is important. We need a way to return a list of relevant donation centers
             to a donor. However, the term “relevant” varies from donor to donor. As such, a donor-user needs a way to filter
             the results by location, accepted items, and causes supported. In order for donors to make informed, but quick,
             decisions about their donations, all of the just mentioned information, along with any perks received from donating,
             should be easy to find for each individual donation center.
           </br></br>
             Similarly, donation center employees are also busy.  They want their businesses and organizations to run smoothly so
             they can better impact people’s lives.  To do so, they need to manage the flow of their goods and specifically the
             influx of specific, desirable items.  Mobile-first is important, but we will need to make sure our solution works
             nicely on the computer in the donation center. First starting up a page for a center needs to be intuitive, and
             updating that page also needs to be quick, as it might be done by volunteers. Donation center employees should have
             a simple experience figuring out what information they need to input and how to input it in order to appear properly
             in donors’ search results and provide an accurate description of their donation center. </p>
          </br></br></br>

          <h5>IMPACT</h5>
          <p>People looking to donate will have an easier experience finding what would be most valuable to donate and how to do so;
            the activation energy required for donating will decrease. Donation centers will be more likely to receive relevant supplies
            that they can accept by broadcasting their needs through our service.</p>
