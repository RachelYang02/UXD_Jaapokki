          <h5>FORMAL USABILITY STUDY</h5>
        </br>
          <p>EXPERIMENT DESIGN
          </br></br>Much of our feedback throughout the design process has been about the
             first task a user attempts when they visit our app: using our search function.
             We flipped between a mad-libs style search form with a lot of structure, and a
             completely free form search bar, but neither was really satisfactory to our users.
             We’d like to improve on our initial ideas and rigorously test which is better and why.
             We are operating under the assumption that our current implementation of the search
             function is the wrong implementation for our users, and that another version might
             more effectively communicate the capabilities and uses of the feature.</p>
           </br>
           <p>Our (quasi-)control is our current free-form search augmented with a better explanation.
             The first alternative option we’ll be testing is a search bar with animated ghost text that suggests
             possible search queries. We’ll also test another iteration of the mad-libs style form (a number of
             text boxes with specific requested inputs), improved based on our previous feedback. </p>
           </br>
           <p>As such, the things that will vary include the explanation text above the search bar,
             the ghost text, and the specificity of the search bar. In each of the three different
             versions, only the one element specific to that version will vary: the other two elements
             will be constant. For example, in the quasi-control version, the explanation text will be
             expanded, but the ghost text and number of search bars/function of the search bar will not
             be changed. Elements that will remain constant throughout all three versions include the
             task the test subject is assigned and the feedback received from searching (the search
             results and how they are displayed).</p>

           <p>EXPERIMENT RESULTS
           </br></br>
             During this study, we observed that our text explanation was useful, but not very exciting to our users.
             Several of our users expected the text to be clickable, which might be attributable to how the text was
             formatted in this prototype (the paragraphs were widely spaced apart). The ghost text went a long way toward
             helping the user understand how to actually interact with the site. Both the ghost text and the mad libs
             implementations changed the use of the app by prompting users to consider who they were donating to and why,
             as opposed to just how to get rid of their stuff; the mad libs version might have done so to greater extent
             because its “to support” search prompt is more explicit.
           </br></br>
             We measured our “how easy is the task” variable before and after our testers used the prototypes. For each one,
             the task of donating a couch was perceived as easier after using our app. There was not a significant difference
             between versions of our app.
           </br></br>
             We observed the frustration/confusion variable as our testers were using the app. Our users seemed most confident
             and happy using the ghost text prototype. It was intuitive to find an explanation in the location of interaction
             instead of elsewhere on the page.
           </br></br>
           <img src="images/fus_results.png">
             We’ve decided to move ahead with the ghost text. Another suggestion we’d like to follow through on if we have the
             time was either replacing or supplementing some of our text explanations with icons and pictures. This could make
             the site more inviting and potentially explain its use more succinctly. We were also reminded during this study that
             we need to implement an about page for our website.</p>

           <p class="extra-padding">Our description of what Donatr does and the functionality of the home
             search bar didn't connect with our testers. They believed that the search box itself was
             unclear as to whether a user was donating or accepting. We fixed this by changing our
             description to make it more clear that users use the search bar to find donation centers
             based on their parameters, whether that is what they want to donate, where they want to
             donate, or to whom they want to donate.

           Consistency and Standards (4)</p>
           <p class="extra-padding">There was a miscommunication with our testers about our prototype that caused
             them to flag a problem that didn’t exist. Because our first prototype in Figma crashed and didn’t
             give us a proper clickable prototype, we decided to construct a real Heroku web-app prototype last-minute.
             Since we didn’t have time to completely implement some of the frames in the real prototype that we had
             constructed in Figma, we gave our testers the real prototype along with images of the frames that weren’t
             included. However, the testers assumed that the additional frames were all of the frames we had made in
             Figma, and didn’t understand the relationships between them because they were incomplete. Because of this
             miscommunication, we did not need to change our actual design or prototype.

             result, but we understand that this critical information was not visible enough. We edited the styling
             so that it was clearer to see and easier to find.

           <p class="extra-padding">We decided that when a user selected a time to schedule a pickup, they would do so in a calendar
              format. For our testers, this calendar was clunky and not specific enough. They felt that the users
              wouldn’t have the flexibility of choosing smaller time frames, say 15-minute blocks versus the one-hour
              blocks that the calendar allowed for. We removed the calendar and made it a form instead, so that the user
              could be as clear and specific as possible about which times they are available for a volunteer or the
              donation center to pick up their donation.

           Error Prevention (2)</p>
            <p class="extra-padding">We wanted flexibility in scheduling pickups because we understand that people have different preferences when it comes
            to who comes to pick up their donations — some may prefer to trust only the donation centers whereas others are more
            open to accepting pickups from volunteers. We provided both options (volunteer pickup versus employee pickup), but we
            had separate pages for both that required the same information. This formatting didn’t provide enough friction that
            made a user commit to one type of pickup instead of another. To fix this flaw, we have one scheduling pickup page that
            includes a toggle so that the user must choose and commit to one option.

           <p class="extra-padding">We also received feedback that the search results didn’t clearly signify that they could be clicked on to
           expand and give more information; so, we changed the background color of a result in the search results
           list when hovering over it, as well as a “>” right arrow to indicate clickability.
         </br></br></br>
           Consistency and Standards (7)</p>
           <p class="extra-padding">The testers didn’t understand the calendar; they thought it was unnecessary and unclear. In revising the prototype,
           we removed the calendar and replaced it with a clear form to input the date and time.
         </br></br></br>
          Visibility of System Status (14)</p>
         <p class="extra-padding">The order of our app flow was that, if a user wasn’t signed in when scheduling a pickup, the app would make them
         sign in and then return them back to that page. It wasn’t clear that the user would be returned to the page after
         signing in. We fixed this by including text on the schedule page saying that logging in will return the user to
         help them build the correct model of our app flow.
