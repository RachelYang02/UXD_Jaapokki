          <h5>DESIGN AND FUNCTION</h5>
          <p>Donatr is a web platform for facilitating collaborative donation.
             From the homepage, users can search whatever is relevant to their donation needs.
             The user is automatically presented with a list of donation centers relevant to
             their search, along with basic information about each result. Clicking on a result
             shows more detailed information about that specific donation center. From here,
             users have ideally found enough information to decide if they want to use this
             donation center and how to get there. Furthermore, users can also schedule a pickup
             from this page, which entails scheduling for a donation center employee or a volunteer
             to pick up their items for donating. Before scheduling a pickup, however, the user has
             to login (which they are prompted to do if they are scheduling a pickup, or they can
             access from any page in the app). </p>

          <h5>CHANGES BETWEEN PAPER PROTOTYPE AND AUTOMATED PROTOTYPE</h5>
        </br>
          <pbe>TRADE-OFFS + DOWN-SCOPING</pbe>
          <p class="extra-padding">In this prototyping and refinement phase, we
            chose to stay in a relatively low-fidelity mode of operation. For example,
            we chose to implement only the mobile layout of our website, whereas the
            website would in reality have a responsive design that works on desktop,
            tablet, and mobile. We had to sacrificed an actual mobile webpage for speed
            of prototyping; we just made it based on a browser window shrunk to phone
            size. We also chose to omit actual images and graphs from the prototype.</p>
          </br></br>
          <p class="extra-padding">We also down-scoped our project given our time constraints.
            For example, in this phase we simplified our profile interface and its subsidiaries.
            We also chose not to prototype the login/signup in a robust manner because its features
            would be much easier to prototype in code than in graphics. As mentioned elsewhere
            in this document, login and signup flows have been standardized across many apps and
            websites, so we would not gain much by visually fleshing out such a well-known interaction
            without being able to think about feedback speed and types. In addition, we did not prototype
            what happens after a donor confirms a pickup time for their donation — it would have given them
            some sort of contact information or in-app messaging system that directly connects donor to
            volunteer / center. We had gotten feedback in the HE that addressed this piece was missing,
            and if had the time to prototype this interaction, we could have gotten more useful
            feedback. Continuing into  the next phase of this project, we are choosing to only
            build out the donor-side interaction, and will not be implementing the volunteer-side
            interaction due to lack of time.</p>

          </br></br>
            <pbe>RESPONSES TO PAPER PROTOTYPE FEEDBACK</pbe>
            <p class="extra-padding">We received feedback from our original user tests on our paper
              prototypes that our homepage search function was too complicated, and that a single
              search bar might be more usable.  As a result, we designed our virtual prototype with
              a single, “omni” search bar. However, we have since received feedback that our single
              search bar is too simple. The simplicity of a single search bar can lead to users being
              unsure about how to use it, whereas a complicated form was too restraining and confusing.</p>
            </br></br>
            <p class="extra-padding">We received feedback that users wanted to be able to connect our
              app with accounts they use regularly, like Facebook and Google. As a result, we
              integrated third-party login into our designs for the login/signup page of our virtual prototype.</p>

            </br></br>
              <pbe>RESPONSES TO TEAM-INTERNAL DELIBERATIONS</pbe>
              <p class="extra-padding">We debated on what information to include on the homepage;
                information about previous donations, scheduled donations, community outreach, etc.
                We settled on nothing but a bit of text explaining our website and a search bar.
                We since got feedback that for return users, that’s wasted space. </p>

            </br></br>
              <pbe>RESPONSES TO HEURISTIC EVALUATION FEEDBACK</pbe>
              <p class="extra-padding">The following is a response to a heuristic evaluation we received, found <a style="color:#4682B4" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DYa-E4Eq_HE8T4NCy0qOef4Jfqrs7XQWsPEttE26RdE/edit?usp=sharing">
                here</a>.</p>
              </br>
              <p class="extra-padding">We received feedback that we need to think critically about error navigation
                as we build out our login and signup functions, which we did not have time to prototype robustly in
                this phase. Furthermore, as login and signup flows are typically very standard across websites and
                apps, we did not feel strongly about fleshing out this familiar interaction for our prototype,
                since this would be very implied.</p>
              </br>
              <p class="extra-padding">We designed our search results to show more information when clicked,
                but failed to implement a successful indication of that interaction. We need to rethink what
                information appears on our search result page.</p>
              </br>
              <p class="extra-padding">We learned that the testers found our home page confusing; in particular,
                they did not know why they were on our website or what to do with the search bar. Expanding upon
                the text on the homepage to explain that the search bar is an “omni-search bar”, and affords any
                kind of search (donation location, item, cause), could help mitigate this problem.</p>
              </br>
              <p class="extra-padding">Our “schedule pickup” flow is both overly complicated and not specific enough,
                and could stand to be improved. For example, instead of two different pickup modes (volunteer and
                employee), we might have one mode with a volunteer/employee option. The scheduling calendar also
                needs to be clarified—are you booking a window of time, or a specific time?—and could be enhanced
                by offering integration of the user’s Google calendar, for example.</p>
              </br>
              <p class="extra-padding">They were surprisingly unconcerned with knowing anything about the
                volunteers coming to their homes. However, all of the users we interviewed in the previous
                phase asked about this, so we’re planning on addressing it.</p>

              </br></br>
              <h5>KEY INSIGHTS</h5>
              <p>We had a very difficult time prototyping our design using Figma. We found the software surprisingly
                unintuitive to new users, despite its functional similarity to tools like Adobe Illustrator. A great deal
                of our time in this phase went toward trying to figure out how to make our prototypes and dealing with
                bugs in Figma’s software. In the future, we might not choose to work with Figma’s software again.
              </br></br>
                We learned the importance of providing appropriate context to the people who are testing your prototype.
                If the testers are not fully aware of the context of the app (such as the intended users and use cases)
                the feedback they provide might not be as relevant as it had the potential to have. Furthermore, explaining
                that this was a prototype, not a finalized product, might have been useful. Many comments that we received
                had to do with certain things being not fully fleshed out, yet part of the point of the heuristic evaluation
                was “not focus on features that are missing, but would clearly be added”. </p>
              </br></br>
              <h5>QUESTIONS AND FUTURE SHORTCOMINGS</h5>
              <p>In our next phase, we will need to explore the following topics:
                <p class="extra-padding"> -- Inclusivity + safety with regard to user profiles and communication between users
                                        </br></br>
                                          -- Coming up with a framework for very intuitive and robust searching
                                        </br></br>
                                          -- Finding an unobtrusive but reliable way to alert users about pickups</p></p>
