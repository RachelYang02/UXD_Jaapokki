          <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
          <p>How might we help connect people who want to donate specific goods to nonprofits
             and other groups that need those goods via a software interface?</p>
          </br></br>
          <p>We want to provide an easier experience -- lower the activation energy, if you will --
            for people looking to donate by helping them find what would be most valuable to donate
            and how to do so. By broadcasting their needs and current supplies, nonprofits and donation
            centers can more easily help those in need.</p>
          </br></br></br>

          <h5>COLLECTION TECHNIQUE</h5>
          <p>We needed to understand the current frustrations and common blocking agents for donation
            centers when it came to collecting donations, and for potential donors trying to figure out how best
            to donate. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we needed to know what makes donations easy for
            either group of users, and if there was something like this out there already that they use (if so, what).
            We collected this information through user visits, observations, and asking them to reflect on their
            experiences. Once we narrowed down the specific type of donation centers we wanted to focus on, we either
            asked other students to share contacts they have collected from previous projects or researched contact information
            for those types of donation centers within our area. We then reached out and established contact via email or a phone call.</p>
          </br></br></br>

          <h5>TEAM PROCESS</h5>
          <p>We worked together to research the problems facing our users, then designed a mockup of a potential solution.
            We then put our mockup in front of users and used their feedback to improve our initial ideas and calibrate our assumptions.
            We iterated on this process until we were confident we head an adequate prototype. Our learning goals were largely centered
            around creating intuitive designs with users in mind, and as such we worked together as a team to seek frequent feedback and
            implement our project.  Another learning goal was centered around mobile-friendly interface design, so we will be placing equal
            weight on mobile and desktop versions of the interface, if we choose to pursue a web interface.</p>
