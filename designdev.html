          <h5>INTERFACE OVERVIEW</h5>
          <p>There are a variety of reasons why people might want to donate goods.
             Some people realize they have too many old clothes, others are moving
             and quickly need to get rid of a lot of items, and some people just
             want to feel good about helping support some cause. In general, there
             exist three problems that block donors from delivering their items to
             donation acceptors: they are not sure where to donate, they do not have
             the time to bring their donation to an acceptor, or they do not have
             the physical transportation means to get their donation to an acceptor.
          </br><br>
            Our application is not meant to motivate people to donate; rather, Donatr
            (working title) will help people get past whichever blocker at which
            they are stuck: Donatr serves to make donating goods as easy as possible.
            We provide a way for people to search for what they want to do - “donate
            a couch,” “centers in Needham” - and show them a results list of relevant
            donation acceptors. Each search result provides relevant information
            (what the center does and does not accept, location, hours), and a way
            to schedule for a volunteer to pick up and deliver a donation based on
            the user’s availability. Throughout this phase, we have refined the
            searching experience and evolved the volunteer pick up feature to
            cater to what users expect and want.</p>

        <p>To begin our process we individually sketched a number of different
          features. Through this process, we gained an idea of what features might
          be important and achieved a starting point for our interface.
        </br></br>
        In order to find the best interface for our end users’ needs, we first had
        to ideate through a variety of differently implemented interfaces. From a
        number of our users, we found that people want some sort of search functionality.
        They already have an objective when they come to our website, so they do
        not want to be distracted from completing that objective. Whether that
        objective is to find nearby donation centers, centers that accept couches,
        or anything else, they want to be able to tell our interface that that is
        what they want to do.</p>

        <p>We had two very early-stage mock ups that did not involve searching;
          rather, they presented the user with information that we, not the users,
          thought might be useful. These two interfaces, The Tinder One and The
          Netflix One, were soon abandoned because they fell short of providing
          users the tools to fulfill their needs.
        </br></br>
        As such, a third interface that we explored was centered around a search
        bar and search results. Users could search for whatever they wanted and
        could view information about relevant donation centers, but they were
        unable to do much beyond that. We previously identified some of the core
        parts of our personas to include time sensitivity and inability to transport
        donations. This interface did not address these problems, and one user
        pointed out to us that our implementation provided nothing beyond what
        existing services, such as Yelp, provide.</p>

        <h5>ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTATION</h5>
          <img src="images/DD/gifs/searchform.gif"
            class="img-responsive" alt="">
        <p>Our original implementation of our interface was misaligned with fulfilling
          our users’ needs due to a combination of excess distractions and ignorance
          of our personas’ key traits. Our home page consisted of a “Mad Libs” style
          form that grew each time the user entered more information. Each “blank”
          in the form was meant to get a specific piece of information about a user’s
          donation needs. However, users are not aware at first that the form will
          continue to grow and not all users want to enter information in the
          order we were requesting it. As such, users were confused and worried
          about entering in the wrong information. Our decision to stray from this
          form is explained in more detail below in the failures section.
        <img src="images/DD/gifs/clutteredsearchresult.gif"
          class="img-responsive" alt="">
        After filling out each question in the form, users were presented with a
        list of applicable donation centers, each one presented along with minimal
        information (logo, address), which was refined every time more information
        was entered into the form. By clicking on one location, users were taken
        to a page dedicated to that donation acceptor. Each acceptor’s page would
        be maintained by employees of that donation center, who would have to log
        in to our platform.
        <img src="images/DD/gifs/schedule1.gif"
          class="img-responsive" loop=infinite alt="">
        We also included a way for users to schedule pickups to take their donations to
        donation centers if they don't have the transportation or the time.</p>
        </br></br>
        <h5>CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION (at the end of this phase)</h5>
        <p>The design that we settled on at the end of this phase consists of a
          landing page with a simple objective: a prominent general search bar,
          a short explanation of the purpose of our site, and a login button.
          First-time visitors might need an explanation of our volunteer pickup
          system, and through user research we have determined that the home page
          is an appropriate place to hold this information.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The search bar provides a way for users to express their reasons for
          coming to our website in whatever way they see fit. A minimalistic search
          results list implies that clicking on a given result will lead to expanding
          the information presented.</p>
        </br>
        <img src="images/DD/gifs/schedule2.gif"
          class="img-responsive" alt="">
        <p>After getting to a specific donation acceptor’s page, the user is presented
          with information about that specific center. From user research, we have found
          what information is the most useful information to show here, explained in the
          failures section below. A significant addition to this page is a button that
          will lead users to an interface where they can schedule to have a volunteer
          pick up their donation and deliver it to the center. The scheduling interface
          is a calendar, which is also explained below in the failures section.</p>
        <img src="images/DD/gifs/volunteer.gif"
            class="img-responsive" alt="">
        <p>There is also a way for users to sign up to volunteer to pickup others’ donations.
            If users are signed in to volunteer, we have another page where they can
            look through possible pickups based on time, distance, and donation item.
            They can narrow or widen the sliders on their timeline, and various
            people looking for pickups pop up on a map as pinpoints that can be
            opened up for more information on the donor.</p>
        </br></br>
        <h5>INSIGHTS (a better word than failures)</h5>
        <p>USERS</p>
        <p>During this Design development process, we have changed our targeted
          user group. Our initial user group was divided into two main categories:
          donors and donation acceptors. With our current design, donation centers
          might not need to interact with the product to benefit from it.  We had
          previously envisioned donation centers maintaining profiles on the interface,
          but now believe all necessary information about each donation center could
          be scraped from existing web content, and that this option might provide
          more accurate and up-to-date information for our users. Our current interface
          design focuses on donors and volunteers who transport donations to donation centers.</p>
        </br>
        <p>FEATURE-SPECIFIC INSIGHTS FROM USABILITY TESTING</p>
        <p>In testing our paper prototype, we found that users tend to like using
          our interface. However, our usability tests left us with some areas of
          the interface to improve to better fulfill our users’ needs. Some of the
          most critical changes are highlighted here:</p>
        <p class="extra-padding">Homepage
        </br>
        Our homepage was oversimplified, and our users
          subsequently couldn’t understand the purpose of the product without our
          explanation.  In the future, we will need to include a summary of what
          the product is on the homepage as well as a link to frequently asked questions.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="extra-padding">Search Function
        </br>
          Our users were somewhat confused by our initial “Mad Libs” sentence-building
          search feature; one person tried to enter the entire phrase “how to donate a
          couch today” into a textbox we intended to only include items to donate, and
          another thought it would be irritating to be forced to use the feature every
          time she wanted to donate.  Users were especially confused by our ghost text,
          which gave suggestions in each search category.  This was perhaps a pitfall
          of working on paper as opposed to on a screen with animation capability. We
          refined the design during the testing process to include a single, all-encompassing
          search bar that would be heavily reliant on natural language processing.
          Our users had more success with this version of the feature. After switching
          our interface to have a general search bar, users found the searching process
          intuitive because they could search for anything they wanted; there were no unclear constraints.
          After selecting a result to view details about a given donation acceptor,
          users generally liked the information they were provided.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="extra-padding">Hierarchy of Information
        </br>
        <img src="images/DD/hierarchy.JPG"
          class="img-responsive" alt="">
          The primary insight on our current implementation of search results is
          that we need to refine our hierarchy of information.  Each result contains
          information about the donation centers, including address, phone number,
          accepted goods, information about the cause supported, hours of operation,
          and a link to schedule a donation pickup. This issue of importance also
          came up on the pickup-scheduling page.  Further user research is required
          to determine which of these details should be prioritized visually.
          Although we received feedback about how better to organize the information,
          the overall structure of the pages was what users expected and wanted.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="extra-padding">Volunteer Information
        </br>
        Our users need more information about the volunteers than we currently
        provide to feel comfortable interacting with them, as users will be placed
        in a vulnerable position when volunteers come to or into their homes to
        collect donations.  This information should include a recent photograph,
        description of the vehicle used for the pickup (make, model, color, license
        plate number, etc.), their volunteer history (number of past donation pickups
        and overall ratings), a way to contact the volunteer directly, and possibly
        background checks or other security measures. Though it needs refinement,
        all of our users enjoyed the volunteer pickup feature and we found that this
        is the area from which we will gain the most value by putting more effort into
        further refinement in future iterations.</p>
      </br>
      <p class="extra-padding">User profiles
      </br>
      We expect that this product would be used by users relatively infrequently,
      and thus for convenience, our product should offer the ability to login with
      a Facebook or Google.  This assumption was confirmed by users during testing.
      Our user testing also suggested that user profiles should also include a history
      of past donations made via our product with the ability to leave feedback on
      volunteers, and a history of benefits gained through donation (including tax
      write-offs).  Users also wanted a clean way to integrate their scheduled pickups
      with their current calendar solutions.</p>
      </br>
      <p class="extra-padding">Donor-volunteer communication channels
      </br>Our users expressed a need for a way to reach out to volunteers regarding
      scheduled pickups, and vice versa.  Some users wanted a secure, relatively
      anonymous communication system, such phone calls through our website/app such
      that no two parties ever had each others’ numbers or a text-based anonymous email
      system like Craigslist. In this case, a more logical implementation might be
      something closer to how Uber drivers are able to make phone calls to riders without
      seeing their phone numbers, and instead simply clicking a button to dial the rider.</p>
    </br></br>
    <h5>ALTERNATIVE SUCCESS</h5>
    <p>One of our users also used the interface to achieve the given test objective
      in a way that we had not fully considered. He simply used the product as a
      more specific, donation-center-only search engine. Once he had reached the
      search results page, he had successfully found the information he was looking for,
      and felt confident he could then make his donation. This use case is aligned
      with the overarching purpose of the product, which is to simplify the process of
      donation goods, though this user only needed to remove one of the three outlined
      roadblocks to donation. He just needed to know where to take his specific item;
      he already had the time and means of transportation to make the donation. The
      interface thus successfully filled his needs.</p>
