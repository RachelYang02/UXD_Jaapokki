        <div class = "col-md-7 col-md-6">

          <p class="extra-padding"><a href="https://good360.org">https://good360.org</a> - (Rachel)</br>
              Good360 connects companies and individuals to nonprofits who need
              donations. They allow donors to fill out forms detailing what type
              of donation they want to make, and then they take the steps behind
              the scenes to find a non-profit that wants to accept the donation.
            </br></br>
              What Good360 does well is it helps the donors to really connect
              with the process of donating. They splash all over their front
              page their statistics of everyone they’ve helped, and they promote
              that donors will get to see the impact of what they donate. This
              is important, since it's come up in conversations. For example, when
              talking with the guest from the Cubed school, he stressed how he
              was tired of donating to Goodwill because he’d rather know where
              he was donating to, who was going to be positively impacted.
            </br></br>
              Good360 also has a good base for what the donation form should
              look like, including fields for donors to input information like a
              description, quality (and units of measure), photos, whether the
              donor can ship straight to the recipient or now, whether the
              donation can be split between multiple nonprofits, etc. They also
              provide an option between donating goods and donating cash. We’d
              probably borrow some elements from this donation process.
            </br></br>
              What they don’t do well is a clean UI — sometimes their
              header disappears when you scroll, making it hard to find the
              About Us page, the How it Works page, the Our Impact page: all
              important information for users (especially first-time users) to
              know. They also clutter their pages with a lot of pictures and a
              lot of words and a lot of elements that make it feel a bit chaotic,
              especially when you minimize the page to a smaller view size than full screen.</p>

        <p class="extra-padding"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/too-good-to-go-fight-food-waste-save-great-food/id1060683933?mt=8">
          https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/too-good-to-go-fight-food-waste-save-great-food/id1060683933?mt=8</a> - (Gaby)</br>
          Too Good to Go is a mobile app aimed at decreasing food waste that connects restaurants,
          bakeries, and supermarkets to customers who pre-purchase leftover food.  The app features
          three ways of searching for leftover shares: a map view, a list view (sorted by distance from the user),
          and a search function, which allows the user to search by zip code, vendor name, or food type.
          Selecting a vendor entry gives details about the leftover share offered, including the price of the
          share and how many are available today (each vendor sells a set number of shares on a given day).
          All monetary transactions are completed in-app; the vendor deactivates your digital share when they give you the goods.
        </br></br>
          Our interface could utilize a map feature similar to this one, especially if the map results could be dependent
          on search input.  What is most inspiring about this app, though, is the values it emphasizes. The goal of this
          app is to eliminate waste within a community.</p>

        <h5>Craigslist</h5>
        <div class="col-md-7 col-md-6">

        </div>

          <p class="extra-padding"><a href="https://boston.craigslist.org/">https://boston.craigslist.org/</a> - (Sean)</br>
            Craigslist is relevant because it’s a platform designed to connect unwanted goods and services with people
            who want them. It has the option to list requests as well as list things you want to sell. However, there
            are a number of features we want to include that are not part of the fairly rudimentary Craigslist platform.
            First, we’d like to make a more intelligent connection between offerings and requests; a potential buyer on
            Craigslist has to both post a request and search through all the current listings. Our application should be
            able to simplify those processes into one with significantly less energy on the part of the user. The second
            is illustrated by the image below. Our app should simplify finding goods and services, perhaps with a tagging
            system instead of a strict many-tiered hierarchy like Craigslist. Our app won’t look like Craigslist, but it
            does have valuable lessons to be learned.</p>

          <p class="extra-padding"><a href="http://donorschoose.org/">http://donorschoose.org/</a> - (Jordan)</br>
            Donorschoose.org allows for users to search for causes based on location, what they donation will be used for,
            school, and teachers. In our app, we plan to allow users to search based on different levels of granularity or
            with different sets of parameters. Their interface for searching is well organized. First, the user searches
            with a general term, such as city. Then, after loading an initial list of matches, refinement suggestions appear.
            Each search result has a quick summary of how a donation will help, allowing users to make informed decisions when donating.</p>

            https://www.yelp.com</a></br>
             Yelp has a more general function, allowing you to search for any
             services nearby your current location. It’s more typically used for finding nearby
             restaurants, and showing the reviews from previous users’ interactions
             (that ultimately rate the business), but it can also be used, as shown above,
             to find nearby donation drop off facilities and visualizes the most relevant options on a map.</p>

             Goodwill is a nonprofit that serves as a thrift store, accepting donations
             that donors drop off at their locations. They provide a nice location map
             for all nearby Goodwills on their website to help donors figure out
             where to donate."></output></p>

             This website allows users to search for homeless shelters in an area and provides a link
             for more information about each. This site is fairly intuitive to use and does not crowd
             too much information into one area. </p>

             Salvation Army is a charitable organization that also accepts donations. They
             provide a nice location map to make it easier for donors to find nearby
             locations, and even give donors an option to pick up their donations for free.</p>
